# [An experiment-driven process]

This is a documentation of how we've been running experiments on Stickies.io

This website uses a theme called [Agency](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-agency).
Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).

# Compiling CSS

If you are editing this page's CSS, save your changes in your text editor and in your command line, type:

`lessc less/agency.less css/agency.css`

Then you should see your changes locally (and on the Github page). You can't push any changes to styles without doing this!
